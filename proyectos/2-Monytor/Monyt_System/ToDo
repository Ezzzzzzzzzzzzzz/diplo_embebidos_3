This is the To Do list:

* Add logging to the rest of the modules, using syslog
* Add threads on the server notifier side to let add more than one notifier
* Add configuration files to load initial configuration, and configuration to each module loaded by sensor or notifier modules
* Improve the way the initial scripts are handler, because now just the start works
* Create more modules, specially on the GSM side

* Add notifiers via network
* Add an API so you can check the status of the sensors via executing a GET method
* Add functionality so it can handle actuators

* Improve every aspect as posible, taking the hints of our modules evaluators
