# Monytor GPS and GSM

Here are two important parts of our system, that we integrate to have a demonstration of our system that is still under development. 

These are the two modules:

- GPS - Simple program that reads from a GPS board and prints the latitude and the longitude.
- GSM - Simple GSM module that is able to send messager, just send in this iteration.

Here we have two important scripts, that we need to execute in order to make work the GSM module.

Finally we have the package that we need to compile and install on our buildroot image.
