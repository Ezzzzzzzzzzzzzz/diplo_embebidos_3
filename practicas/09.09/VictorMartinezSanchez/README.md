# Makefile

Example program to use a `Makefile` tool to compile/install an example program.

The `Makefile` created has these directives:

	all
	bin
	clear
	clean
	run
	install
	uninstall

They do what they intend to, the only difference between `clear` and `clean` is
that `clear` does not remove the executable.
