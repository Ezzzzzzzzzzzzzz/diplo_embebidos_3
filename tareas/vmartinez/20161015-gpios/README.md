# GPIOS input and output test

The objective of this homework it to test the GPIOs of our development board.
My script only works for a Intel Galileo Gen2.

The function of the script if to On a buzzer when the voltage input is greater 
than 1V, This means that I only use Analog Input and a Digital output (Actually
is an Analog output but I only can write on it 0 or 1).

I found a lot of useful information about the Intel Galileo Gen2 in [this](http://www.malinov.com/Home/sergey-s-blog/intelgalileo-programminggpiofromlinux)
and [this](https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/intel-galileo-and/9781430268383/9781430268390_AppB.xhtml) webpages.
