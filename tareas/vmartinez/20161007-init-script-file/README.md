# Init Script/File

This is the configuration file for systemd it works for start, status and stop
just this options where tested but some others could work, the executable daemon
was tested by the examples provided by the instructor, and [this](https://github.com/jirihnidek/daemon/blob/master/src/daemon.c)
other on github.

Soon I would like to add the init script for sysV
